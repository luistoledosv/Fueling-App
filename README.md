# Fueling App
This project is an experiment that I started to create with Chat GPT from Open.ai. My goal is to learn how to code through the AI and develop my codigng skills.

**App Scenarios:**
- Login
- Register
- Fueling Income

**Functionalities:**
- User starts registrating his account
- In the Login screen the user autenticate his access
- After the autentication the user are allowed to be redirect to the Fueling screen
- In the fueling screen is possible to add the fueling data by date, distance, fuel amount, gas price and location.
- All the data is stored in localstorage and displayed in a table
- After the user end his session, he could logout.
